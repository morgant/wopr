WOPR: WOrkspace PReparation scripts
===================================

by Morgan Aldridge <morgant@makkintosshu.com>

OVERVIEW
--------

A couple of preparation scripts (primarily AppleScript, but taking advantage of a few of my other tools as well) I use to automatically set up my apps & workspaces under Mac OS X. It's a personal productivity thing and very specific to my setup, but maybe it'll be useful to others purely as inspiration.

_Yes, it's a rip-off of 'W.O.P.R.' from the War Games movie._
